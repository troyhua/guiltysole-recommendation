Senario:
    Prompt: Which of the two shoes you prefer?
            A: (Render info for shoe A)
            B: (Render info for shoe B)
    (option: A, B, S)
    (repeat this steps, S is for showing the current shoes ranking)

Algorithm:
    Assumption: We have a Hilbert space ( which can compute the similarity or distance of any pair of nodes in the space ), here a node is a shoe/SKU and the similarity is calculated based on attributes and user transaction history ( which is not available now ).
